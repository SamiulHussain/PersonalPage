  <h2 class="title">Personal Statement / Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently a student at City, University of London. I am studying
    <i>Computer Science with Cyber Security (MSci)</i>
    which will provide me with the knowledge required in order to
    become a Cyber Security analyst. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To assist me in this I took on a cybersecurity course on 
    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and regularly used the coding knowledge
    I gained during my A-Levels as well as  in my own time through experimentation. For 
    example, I used Unity to create a game for my final project but I had no prior knowledge
    at all on C#. After constant attempts to learn and get used to the language I was
    able to fully conclude my project and I was happy with what I was able to make.

  <p>
    In my free time, I play football weekly as it allows me to build my teamwork skills
    with my friends and on occassion with any other strangers in tournaments.
    This also allows me to play in a manner which helps me destress as well as push
    me to become better and improve a variety of soft skills.

  <p>
  These games usually take place at the end of the week (Friday - 3PM+), which
  gives all the players something to look forward to rather than having to schedule
  it in on different days which could be difficult during intense weeks of university
  or work. Due to the casual aura of the games, it is very easy to get to know any
  new players. Personally, I have been able to quickly bond with those I had only met
  an hour or so ago by simply playing football with them.
  </p>
  <p>
  Therefore, the transferrable skills I have gained from my hobby will assist in
  creating long-lasting friendships between peers allowing me to efficiently and
  network with a large variety of people while also being able to complete any
  assignments in conjunction with my colleagues.

    <li>French</li>
    <li>History</li>
    <li>Triple Science</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>For my A-Levels I did:</strong></p>
  <ul>

    <li>Sociology</li>
  </ul>

    <h2 class="title">Work Experience</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Virtual Work Experience</strong> - Split into groups of 3 to create
    presentations on specific sets of data, provided with an example simple html website
    which we then moulded around our team's topic (financial data of a company).
    We were only given an hour to create a corresponding powerpoint presentation as
    well as a simple script which we then presented to the rest of the attendees.
    In order to correctly display the data, I used my computer literacy skills to
    use PowerPoint's built in charts. For example, I used a pie chart in order to display
    where the budget was used and how much of it was used. Below is an example of a what
    our pie charts looked like:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>King Kebab</strong> - <i>Flyer Distribution:</i> delivered flyers of the menu to 
    local homes across the wider general area of the restaurant. Rather than just leaving a flyer,
    I always knocked for the opportunity to speak to the homeowners and explain what I was doing. 
    Doing this resulted in a number of more customers coming to the restaurant and also
    leaving reviews of their experience further increasing the number of customers.
